        <p>
          The Leader. You have a great ambition and a strong drive for success.
          You are highly independent and dislike the restrictions of having to
          work with others. You easily become frustrated with the routine.
        </p>

        <h3>Birth Day number 2</h3>

          your close friends and loved ones. You want to be hugged and cuddled.
          There is a tendency to fall into childhood patterns when giving and
          receiving affection.
        </p>

        <h3>Birth Day number 3</h3>
        <p>
          The Creative Child. You have a fine sense of harmony and art in
          everything that you do - from your dress to the way you decorate your
          home. You have a gift with plants and flower arranging.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3>Birth Day number 8</h3>
        <p>
          Balance & Power. Your approach to business is original, creative and
          daring. You have sound judgment and need the freedom to exercise it,

        </p>

        <h3>Birth Day number 9</h3>
        <p>
          Global Awareness. You have a greater social role to play that will
          require a blend of the practical and the humanitarian. You must have a

          efforts toward some greater good.

          win the independence you so deeply want.
        </p>

        <h3>Birth Day number 11</h3>

        </p>

        <h3>Birth Day number 12</h3>
        <p>
          Self Expression. Your artistic talent emerges in virtually everything
          you take seriously, your home, your cooking, the way you express
          yourself, and any artistic endeavor you commit to.
        </p>
        <h3>Birth Day number 13</h3>
        <p>
          - The Rock. You love things that are solid and grounded in the
          practical. Yet, you possess a considerable amount of artistic talent
          that is searching for concrete forms of expression.
        </p>

        <h3>Birth Day number 14</h3>
        <p>
          The Adventurer. You are highly social and work well with others as
          long as there are not too many restrictions to bind you. You get
          restless easily, a characteristic that can make you change vocations
          or relationships much too quickly.
        </p>

        <h3>Birth Day number 15</h3>
        <p>
          Mother-/Fatherhood. There is a yearning within you to ground within
          the family or community structure, but there is a hint of wanderlust,
          too, which makes grounding difficult. You want the best in your life,
          and you strive for it.
        </p>

          penetrating beneath the surface of the subject at hand. You also have
          the capacity for excellent concentration.
        </p>

        <p>

          creative, and daring. You are an excellent manager and organizer. You
          are gifted with the ability to see the larger picture, and,
          remarkably, how the details come into play.
        </p>
        <h3>Birth Day number 18</h3>
        <p>
          The World is your Oyster. You are broadminded and should be educated
          in several different fields, particularly the arts. Many great artists
          are found under this number.
        </p>

        <h3>Birth Day number 19</h3>
        <p>
          The Individualist. As the poet John Donne said: "No man is an Island
          unto himself... We are all bits of the main." This is a central lesson
          in your life: to learn the difference between the dream of
          independence and the reality of interdependence.
        </p>
        <h3>Birth Day number 20</h3>
        <p>
          Bringer of Harmony. You possess great awareness and can sense the
          feelings of others, even when they try to hide their inner thoughts.

          itself in everything you do, from your sparkling conversation to your
          most prized projects. You are quick witted and can think on your feet.
        </p>

        <h3>Day number 22</h3>
        <p>
          The Master Builder. You are an organizer, or builder of an institution
          or business. You have a vision and the capability to materialize it.
          You possess the capacity for great strength, but conversely you can be
          deeply afraid of the dimensions of your ambitions.
        </p>
        <h3>Birth Day number 23</h3>
        <p>
          Adaptable & Versatile. You are highly adaptable, which makes change a
          great deal easier for you than for others. You have an easy way with
          relationships and generally get along well with most people you meet.
        </p>
        <h3>Birth Day number 24</h3>
        <p>
          Teacher & Healer. You are energetic, responsible and helpful, but your
          sympathetic nature may cause you to interfere in relationships and get
          you into trouble. Know your limits.
        </p>
        <h3>Birth Day number 25</h3>
        <p>
          Spiritual Growth. You are capable of investigating and researching
          subjects deeply. Your analytical skills force you to avoid taking
          anything at face value.
        </p>
        <h3>Birth Day number 26</h3>
        <p>
          Between Matter & Spirit. Your challenge is to maintain a balance
          between your material goals and the fundamental human qualities of
          understanding, compassion and love.
        </p>
        <h3>Birth Day number 27</h3>
        <p>
          The People's Spirit. You are a bit of a late-bloomer. You need
          exposure to many different types of people before you find the area in
          which you will specialize. This is also the reason many change careers
          more than once.
        </p>
        <h3>Birth Day number 28</h3>
        <p>
          Self Empowerment. You are unconventional, idealistic, and independent.
          You are extremely ambitious. You possess much self confidence, but

          what you do in life, the world of spirit and philosophy will be
          central to your daily behavior. You feel linked with the larger
          universal forces, and nothing will change that.
        </p>
        <h3>Birth Day number 30</h3>
        <p>
          Perform & Express. You are an artist at heart. You could excel in
          writing, visual, or performing arts. If you are not professionally
          involved in one of these areas, you should consider taking up art as a
          hobby.
        </p>
        <h3>Birth Day number 31</h3>
        <p>
          Power of Work. You are the foundation of any enterprise you commit to,
          doing your work with determination and precision.
